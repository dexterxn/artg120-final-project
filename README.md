Dexter was here!
Added all the different pictures for the game
So was Michael!

Currently I have the basic player movement working. 
To do's
- Keep track of when player has touched an object
- Way to tell the player they need to gather certain things to pass the level

Maybe to dos 
- The walls aren't strictly enforced.
